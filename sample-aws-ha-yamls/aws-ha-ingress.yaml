# If you require your clients to access more than one Docker Repository, you must use an external load balancer (e.g., NGINX) as a reverse proxy instead of this ingress for Docker YAML.
# See our documentation at https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/formats/docker-registry/docker-repository-reverse-proxy-strategies
# Note that <scheme> should typically be set to internal.

# Note: This YAML file is just an example and cannot be used as-is.
# You must fill it out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use it.
# Ignore this file if you don't use docker repositories
