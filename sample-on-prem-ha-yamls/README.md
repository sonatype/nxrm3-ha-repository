# Overview
You can use the sample YAML files in this section to help set up the YAMLs you will need for a High-Availability (HA) Nexus Repository deployment. 
Ensure you have filled out the YAML files with appropriate information for your deployment.

> **Note** The YAML files in this section are just examples and cannot be copy-pasted and used as-is. You must fill them out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use them.

## Storage

### Local storage

By default, the [onprem-ha-statefulset.yaml](onprem-ha-statefulset.yaml) uses local storage. You'll need to create directories
on each node in your Kubernetes cluster for storing Sonatype Nexus Repository runtime data (logs, config dump, etc.).

* The number of directories you create should be driven by the number of Sonatype Nexus Repository instances (i.e., replicas) you wish to run in your Kubernetes cluster.
    Presently, there are five persistence volumes in the [onprem-ha-nexus-data-local-persistent-volume.yaml](onprem-ha-nexus-data-local-persistent-volume.yaml) file.
    Thus, you need to create five directories on each node as shown below:
    ```
    mkdir -p /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/work1
    mkdir -p /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/work2
    mkdir -p /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/work3
    mkdir -p /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/work4
    mkdir -p /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/work5
    ```

* You must chown all the directories you create to ```200:200``` as follows: ```chown -R 200:200 /var/nexus-repo-mgr-work-dir/ ```
